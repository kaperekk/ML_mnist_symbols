Project created to read mnist symbols.
At first I analyse obtained data. Next i make it readable for model,and split into treaning and testing part.
On the next step I create the mode, and train it. After I can test Accuracy and check how can i improve it by looking at confusion matrix. 
And in the end we can test this model by hand mady picture by myself and check how it really works.
